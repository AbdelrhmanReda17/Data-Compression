# Data Compression
This repository contains implementations of three popular compression algorithms: LZ77, LZW, and Huffman. These algorithms are widely used for data compression, helping reduce file sizes for storage and transmission.

## [LZ77 Compression](https://github.com/AbdelrhmanReda17/Data-Compression/tree/main/LZ77)
LZ77 is a sliding-window-based compression algorithm that replaces repeated occurrences of data with references to a single copy. It is widely used in applications such as GIF image format and DEFLATE compression algorithm.
- Features:
  - Sliding window compression approach.
  - Efficient for repetitive data patterns.

## [LZW Compression](https://github.com/AbdelrhmanReda17/Data-Compression/tree/main/LZW)
LZW is a dictionary-based compression algorithm that replaces sequences of characters with single dictionary entries. It is known for its simplicity and effectiveness, and it is used in popular formats like GIF and TIFF.
- Features:
  - Dictionary-based compression.
  - Handles variable-length sequences.

## [Standard Huffman Compression](https://github.com/AbdelrhmanReda17/Data-Compression/tree/main/Huffman)
Huffman coding is a variable-length prefix coding algorithm used for lossless data compression. It assigns variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters.
- Features:
  - Variable-length prefix coding.
  - Optimal for entropy encoding.

## [GUI Application](https://github.com/AbdelrhmanReda17/Data-Compression/tree/main/GUI%20Application)
In addition to the core implementations of LZ77, LZW, and Huffman compression algorithms, this repository also includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application built using IntelliJ IDEA or NetBeans. The GUI application provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the compression algorithms.
- Features:
  - User-friendly Interface: The GUI simplifies the process of compressing and decompressing files using the implemented algorithms.
  - File Selection: Easily select files for compression or decompression through the intuitive file selection interface.
  - Algorithm Options: Choose between LZ77, LZW, and Huffman algorithms with a click, allowing for quick experimentation and comparison.
- How to Run:
  - Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or NetBeans.
  - Locate the main class (e.g., Main.java) for the GUI application.
  - Run the main class to launch the GUI application.
## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/AbdelrhmanReda17/Data-Compression.git
  ```
2. Navigate to the algorithm of interest (e.g., LZ77, LZW, or Huffman) or use the GUI Application.
3. Follow the instructions in the algorithm's README for usage details and examples.
