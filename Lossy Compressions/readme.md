# Lossy Compressions
 - Lossy compression is a technique where some amount of data loss is acceptable to achieve higher compression ratios. Vector Quantization is commonly used in image and speech compression.
 - This folder contains implementations of a popular lossy compression algorithm: Vector Quantization (VQ).
## [Vector Quantization Compression](https://github.com/AbdelrhmanReda17/Data-Compression/tree/main/Lossy%20Compressions/VectorQuantization)
Vector Quantization is a lossy compression technique that involves dividing a signal into non-overlapping vectors and representing each vector by the index of the closest codebook entry. It is widely used in image and speech compression due to its ability to achieve high compression ratios.
- Features:
  - Codebook-based compression.
  - Suitable for applications with acceptable data loss.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/AbdelrhmanReda17/Data-Compression.git
  ```
2. Navigate to **Lossy Compressions Folder** then select the algorithm (Vector Quantization Folder).
3. Follow the instructions in the algorithm's README for usage details and examples.
