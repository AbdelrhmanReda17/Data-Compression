# Lossless Compressions
This Folder contains implementations of three popular compression algorithms: LZ77, LZW, and Huffman. These algorithms are widely used for data compression, helping reduce file sizes for storage and transmission.

## [LZ77 Compression](https://github.com/AbdelrhmanReda17/Data-Compression/tree/main/LZ77)
LZ77 is a sliding-window-based compression algorithm that replaces repeated occurrences of data with references to a single copy. It is widely used in applications such as GIF image format and DEFLATE compression algorithm.
- Features:
  - Sliding window compression approach.
  - Efficient for repetitive data patterns.

## [LZW Compression](https://github.com/AbdelrhmanReda17/Data-Compression/tree/main/LZW)
LZW is a dictionary-based compression algorithm that replaces sequences of characters with single dictionary entries. It is known for its simplicity and effectiveness, and it is used in popular formats like GIF and TIFF.
- Features:
  - Dictionary-based compression.
  - Handles variable-length sequences.

## [Standard Huffman Compression](https://github.com/AbdelrhmanReda17/Data-Compression/tree/main/Huffman)
Huffman coding is a variable-length prefix coding algorithm used for lossless data compression. It assigns variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters.
- Features:
  - Variable-length prefix coding.
  - Optimal for entropy encoding.
## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/AbdelrhmanReda17/Data-Compression.git
  ```
2. Navigate to **Lossless Compressions Folder** then select the algorithm (e.g., LZ77, LZW, or Huffman).
3. Follow the instructions in the algorithm's README for usage details and examples.
